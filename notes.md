After looking over the iniatial task, and looking at the resources given. I began to scratch my head a few times because of the task that was ahead of me. I iniatially had an issue brain storming in using the different tools given for the qualitative data given, as some of the tools given were made for quanitative data. Atleast in my mind. The first tool I wanted to use was Voyant Tools, as I took a big interest in it, and I plan on using it for the rest of my courses. I planned on matching and using the Topic Modelling method, but I came into an error where the Topic Modelling package said there was no archive or the file was damaged and couldn't be opened. I was rather disapointed, and lost as to where to go besides Voyant Tools. 
Using WGET, I found out that the Old Bailey's website is very centralized. There are no links that lead to other websites or resources, having numerous other different threads which explain all their different steps.

Going back to Voyant Tools,I looked through the numerous amounts of data that was given throughout the entire text of the Value of Proceedings as a Historical source. After reading the paper over, and looking at the terms. It shows the importance of the Proceedings. There are claimed to be bias's that go back and forth between the prosecution and defense. Over the course of time, the term Proceedings, was listed 91 times. In relation to this, and their topic. The Proceedings of Old Bailey site holds every record taken down and digatalized which allows them all to be accessible. This goes back up to the idea with WGET that this site is very centralized.

To achieve as full an understanding of the circumstances surrounding a trial as possible it is necessary to consult not only the account of the trial in the Proceedings but also, where available, these associated materials kept in libraries and archives. This is a statement made at the end of the document, which had me think a fair little bit. I would love to look through the entire site, given time to see if there are numerous documents from both sides of the proceedings that are there to back their claim. Or perhaps, see if the Old Bailey site is missing any details.
